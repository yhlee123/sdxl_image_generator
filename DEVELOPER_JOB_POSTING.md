## Project Description

I'm looking for an experienced full-stack developer to build the MVP of an AI-powered character generation platform. The app allows users to create custom AI characters and generate photorealistic images and videos.

**This project is PERFECT for you if you have:**
‚úÖ Strong Next.js 14+ (App Router) experience
‚úÖ Python/FastAPI backend skills
‚úÖ Experience with Stripe payments
‚úÖ Modern UI/UX design sensibility (dark themes, shadcn/ui)
‚úÖ API integration experience (we'll use Replicate for AI generation)

---

## What You'll Build

### **Frontend (Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind)**
- Landing page with hero section and demo content grid
- User authentication (signup, login, password reset)
- Character creation form with dropdowns and text inputs
- Character profile page with image/video gallery
- User dashboard showing all characters
- Pricing page with Stripe checkout
- Account/billing page
- Fully responsive (desktop + mobile)

### **Backend (FastAPI + Python)**
- REST API endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Supabase integration (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- Replicate API integration for image/video generation
- Stripe webhook handling for subscriptions & payments
- Token/credit system logic
- File upload to Cloudflare R2

### **Key Features**
1. **User Authentication**: Email/password signup, login, JWT tokens (using Supabase Auth or NextAuth)
2. **Character Management**: Create, read, update, delete characters
3. **AI Generation Integration**:
   - Call Replicate API for SDXL image generation
   - Call Replicate API for video generation (SVD)
   - Handle job queuing and status checks
4. **Payment System**:
   - Stripe subscriptions (3 tiers: Free, Starter $9.99, Pro $29.99)
   - One-time token purchases
   - Webhook for payment confirmation
5. **Token System**: Track user tokens, deduct on generation, refill on subscription renewal
6. **Media Gallery**: Display generated images/videos, lazy loading

## How to Stand Out

üåü **Show me you've read this carefully** by starting your proposal with "AI Character Gen - [Your Name]"

üåü **Include a Loom video** (2-3 min) walking through one of your relevant projects

üåü **Propose improvements** - if you see ways to make the architecture better, let me know!
