## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: What if I can't find a good developer on Upwork?
**A**: Try these alternatives:
- Fiverr Pro
- Contra (contra.com)
- Post in r/forhire on Reddit
- Dev community Discords (Next.js, React, etc.)
- LinkedIn job posting

### Q: Should I learn to code myself?
**A**: For MVP, hiring is faster. Learn gradually:
- Use Claude Code to understand the codebase your developer creates
- Make small edits yourself (copy, styling)
- Learn Next.js basics after launch for maintenance

### Q: What if video quality isn't good enough?
**A**: Options:
1. Try different motion parameters (see RUNPOD_VIDEO_SETUP.md)
2. Start MVP without video, add in Phase 2
3. Research alternative video models (AnimateDiff, etc.)

### Q: How do I know if the developer is doing good work?
**A**: Check these milestones:
- Week 1: Code should be clean, organized, well-commented
- Week 2: You should be able to test login/signup yourself
- Week 3: You should be able to create a character
- Week 4: You should be able to generate an image from the web app

If developer misses milestones or is unresponsive, don't be afraid to find someone else.

### Q: What if I go over budget?
**A**: Cost-cutting options:
- Use free tiers longer (Supabase, Vercel, Railway all have generous free tiers)
- Launch with fewer features (no video for MVP)
- Do content generation yourself vs. paying developer to do it
- Use Replicate vs. RunPod (simpler, possibly cheaper for low volume)

## 🎓 Learning Resources

As you wait for developer applications and work on sample content, learn the basics:

### **Next.js (Your Frontend)**
- Official Tutorial: https://nextjs.org/learn
- YouTube: "Next.js 14 Tutorial" by Net Ninja or similar

### **Stripe (Payments)**
- Stripe Docs: https://stripe.com/docs
- YouTube: "Stripe Subscriptions Tutorial"

### **Supabase (Database)**
- Official Docs: https://supabase.com/docs
- YouTube: "Supabase Tutorial for Beginners"

*You don't need to become an expert, just understand the basics so you can communicate with your developer and maintain the platform post-launch.*

---

## 📞 Communication Best Practices

### **With Your Developer**
- **Daily Check-ins**: 15-min video call, same time every day
- **Async Questions**: Slack/Discord for quick questions
- **Weekly Review**: 1-hour milestone review
- **Be Responsive**: Reply within 24 hours to unblock them

### **Feedback Tips**
✅ "The character creation form looks great, but can we add a dropdown for eye color?"
✅ "Generation is working, but taking 2+ minutes - is that expected?"
✅ "Can you add a loading spinner when generating images?"

❌ "This is all wrong, redo it"
❌ "Why isn't this like ourdream.ai?"
❌ "Just figure it out"
